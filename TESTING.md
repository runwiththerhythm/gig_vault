## Code Validation

## Defensive Programming & Manual Testing

Defensive programming was manually tested with user acceptance testing across **Gig Vault’s** core features.  
Testing focused on authentication, form validation, CRUD functionality, and access restrictions.  
The goal was to ensure that users cannot manipulate data belonging to other accounts, brute-force URLs, or bypass restrictions.

| Page / Feature | Expectation | Test | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gig Management         | Users can create a new gig with required fields (band, venue, date, etc.)   | Submitted gig creation form with valid data.                         | Gig was created successfully and displayed in the dashboard list.                           | 
|                        | Users cannot submit an empty gig form.                                      | Tried submitting with missing required fields.                       | Form validation prevented submission and displayed error messages.                          | 
|                        | Users can edit their own gigs but not others'.                              | Logged in as User A and attempted to edit User B’s gig.              | Access was denied; only the owner could edit their gig.                                      | 
|                        | Users can delete their own gigs after confirmation.                         | Deleted a gig via the dashboard.                                     | Gig was removed from the database and dashboard refreshed.                                   | 
| Image Uploads          | Users can upload multiple gig images (cover + gallery).                     | Uploaded multiple files using the image picker.                      | All images were stored; one cover image was set automatically.                              | 
| Authentication         | Only registered users can log in and access dashboard.                      | Attempted login with valid and invalid credentials.                   | Valid credentials allowed access; invalid credentials rejected with error message.           | 
|                        | Logged-out users cannot access dashboard pages.                             | Logged out and tried accessing `/dashboard/gigs/`.                   | Redirected to login page as expected.                                                        | 
| Access Control         | User A should not access User B’s gigs.                                     | Navigated manually to another user’s gig detail via URL manipulation. | Access was denied (404/redirect).                                                           | 
|                        | Non-superusers should not access admin pages.                               | Attempted to access `/admin/` as a standard user.                    | Access blocked; redirected to login/denied access page.                                      | 
| Venue Search           | Venue autocomplete must store text fields only (no lat/long).               | Submitted form with Mapbox venue search.                             | Venue details saved correctly as text fields (`venue_name`, `venue_city`, `venue_country`). | screenshot |
| 404 Error Page         | Invalid URLs should return a custom 404 error page.                         | Navigated to `/test123`.                                             | Custom 404 page displayed with styled Gig Vault messaging.                                   |

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

> [!NOTE]  
> I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I used Django’s built-in unittest framework to test Gig Vault’s core functionality (models, views, and helpers). Tests live in gigs/tests.py.

Key tests currently included:

#### Models

Band: string representation.

Venue: string representation (field-agnostic to support either name/city/country or venue_name/venue_city/venue_country).

Gig: creation and other_artists (M2M) behavior.

GigVideo: URL validation via clean() and embed_url property.

GigImage: optional DB constraint test for single is_cover=True per gig (skips if constraint not present).

#### Views

my_gigs: authentication redirect + lists the user’s gigs.

gig_detail: renders and includes venue info.

#### Run the tests

From the project root (same folder as manage.py):
- `python manage.py test`

#### Unit Test Issues

Single cover image constraint

Issue: Wanted to enforce one is_cover=True per gig, but DB constraint wasn’t defined.

Fix: Test auto-skips if the named constraint (unique_cover_per_gig) isn’t found.

Summernote warning

Message: but css_sanitizer not set.

Status: Harmless; does not affect results.
